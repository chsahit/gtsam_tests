A simple tool to help me test the functionality of GTSAM (Georgia Tech Smoothing and Mapping).
This will start with a single node that localizes the robot from odometry readings, but it could grow into more.
The intention is to compare the robots actual location against what GTSAM predicts against what raw odometry predicts
